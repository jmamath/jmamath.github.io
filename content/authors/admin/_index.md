I build synthetic data infrastructure for training frontier language models at scale.

As a Research Engineer at Google, I led the data generation pipeline that enhanced Gemini's multilingual instruction-following capabilities across 25 languages. This work focuses on creating high-quality synthetic instruction-response pairs that bridge the gap between research methods and production systems.

My expertise in synthetic data generation extends across the LLM training lifecycle: instruction-following (SFT), preference-based alignment, and increasingly, pretraining corpus design. I recently published a comprehensive research series on synthetic alignment, synthesizing insights from 20+ papers into actionable guidance for technical leaders evaluating RLHF alternatives.

I'm focused on synthetic data because the economics are inevitable: as frontier models approach human expert performance, the marginal cost of human feedback increasingly exceeds its marginal value. The next competitive advantage lies in architecting generation pipelines that maintain quality while eliminating human bottlenecks—a shift that's already reshaping how leading labs approach training.

This builds on my doctoral research at Sorbonne University, where I developed methods for using synthetic data to predict model behavior under dataset shift—insights that directly inform how I design production pipelines today.
If you're evaluating synthetic data strategies for production systems, I'd welcome the conversation.
